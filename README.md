# 2023_Summer_Program
This is a project completed in a Summer Program in Columbia University . A Game Recommendation System for Steam,I'm Alex,I am mainly responsible for the implementation of the code

**crew members**:Alex, Sen, Cynthia, Lydia, Henry, Ben

**File introduction**:
* Recommender System/Data/steam-200k.csv:The dataset comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamber/steam-video-games) and contains 200,000 pieces of data and four features, namely UserID, game_title, purchase and playhours.

* Recommender System/PPT.pdf:This is for our group's final presentation.

* Recommender System/Recommender System.ipynb:This is the recommendation system code implementation section.This includes data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling using Kmeans, Gaussian mixture, and item-based collaborative filtering respectively

* Recommender System/Recommender System.pdf:Here's our report on the project.

**Computer Configuration**:
The computer configuration using to generate the model is Intel i9 Sixteen-Core Processor with 16GB memory, and the Graphics Card is NIVIDA GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop. The main way to organize the data is python libraries like pandas and NumPy, and the navigator used for this research is anaconda.
